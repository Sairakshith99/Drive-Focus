# Drive Focus (Driver-Attention-Monitoring-System)

# Project Description 

Drive Focus is a project developing a Driver Attention Monitoring System (DAMS) that uses face recognition software on a Raspberry Pi and a PiCamera. By examining facial traits including the driver's eyes and mouth, the system can determine whether or not they are aware. The prominent computer vision library OpenCV is used in C++ programming. The method has the ability to lower the amount of distracted driving-related accidents and raise driving safety. The system's design, implementation, testing, and development process are all thoroughly detailed.
