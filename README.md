# Project Description 

Drive Focus is a project developing a Driver Attention Monitoring System (DAMS) that uses face recognition software on a Raspberry Pi and a PiCamera. By examining facial traits including the driver's eyes and mouth, the system can determine whether or not they are aware. The prominent computer vision library OpenCV is used in C++ programming. The method has the ability to lower the amount of distracted driving-related accidents and raise driving safety. The system's design, implementation, testing, and development process are all thoroughly detailed.

# Requirements

# Project Features

1. Real-time monitoring: The system continuously monitors the driver's behavior and alerts them when they show signs of drowsiness, fatigue, or distraction.

2. Facial recognition: The system detects the driver's face and tracks their eye movement and facial expressions to assess their level of attentiveness.

3. Audio alerts: The system alerts the driver through audio messages or warnings when they show signs of drowsiness or fatigue.

4. Compatibility with existing technology: The system is compatible with existing in-car technology such as infotainment systems and navigation systems to provide a seamless user experience.

5. Privacy and security: The system is designed to protect the driver's privacy and data security by minimizing data collection and ensuring secure storage and transmission of data.

6. Customizability: The system is customizable to meet the needs of different drivers and vehicle types, with adjustable sensitivity levels and alert preferences.
